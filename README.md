# Selection Sort Algorithm

## Description
In this activity, we focus on the **Selection Sort** algorithm, a simple yet important method in the field of sorting algorithms. **Selection Sort** works by repeatedly finding the minimum element (or maximum, depending on the order) from the unsorted part of the list and placing it in the correct position.

## Code Explanation

### Algorithm
The **Selection Sort** algorithm iterates through the list, identifying the smallest (or largest) unsorted element in each pass and swapping it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated until the list is fully sorted.

### Key steps:
1. Iterate over the list and treat each position as the starting point of the unsorted section.
2. Find the smallest element in the unsorted section.
3. Swap the smallest element with the first element of the unsorted section.
4. Repeat until the entire list is sorted.
